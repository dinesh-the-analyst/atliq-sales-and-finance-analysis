## 💡 Insights :

### 1. Customer Performance Report
Amazon represents **13.7%** of your entire revenue (**$82.1M**) - this single-customer concentration is an existential risk that could destroy the business overnight if the relationship sours.

### 2. GM% by Quarters in Subzone
India's gross margin collapsed from **42.35%** (FY2019) to **32%** (FY2021) - a catastrophic **10-percentage-point** loss in your largest market is bleeding millions in profit.

### 3. Market Performance vs Target
**100% target miss rate** across all **23 markets** with **-8.4%** average gap signals your forecasting process is fundamentally broken, not just unlucky.

### 4. Net Sales by Division
N&S division growing at only **84%** (half the company average of **204.5%**) is a massive underperformer dragging down overall potential - immediate diagnostic required.

### 5. New Products 2021
**16 new products** generated **$176.2M** (**29%** of total revenue) from zero base - your product innovation engine is your most valuable competitive asset.

### 6. P&L by Fiscal Months
March 2020 revenue collapsed **87%** (**$15.9M → $2.1M**) revealing dangerous vulnerability to external shocks with no hedging strategy in place.

### 7. P&L for Markets
Germany's **26.18%** gross margin is destroying value - at this margin level, you're likely losing money after operating expenses in a **$12M** market.

### 8. Top & Bottom 5 Products - Qty
You're moving **19M units** of low-margin peripherals while your bottom 5 total only **175K units** - massive volume on wrong products indicates misaligned sales incentives.

### 9. Top 10 Countries by Net Sales
Top 2 markets (India + USA) = **42%** of total revenue while 13 smaller markets contribute only **19%** - massive geographic complexity for minimal return.

### 10. Top 10 Products by Sales
AQ Mx NB achieved **5,623% growth** (**$0M → $1.4M**) - identifying what made this product explode could unlock replicable growth formulas for future launches.
